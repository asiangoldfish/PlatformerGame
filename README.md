# PROG2002 Exam Autumn 2023

# Executing the Program
I have added the bash script [run.sh](./run.sh) to quickly build and run the program. To manually do this, perform the following commands:
```
mkdir build
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
cd build/bin
./MyApplication
```

## Functions
`rng()` and `lerp()`:
This is from Bernt Tore Jensen in the spring semester of 2022. He is a lecturer in the module of BMA1020 - Mathematics 
for Programming. He taught us these functions. This function is also on my GitHub repository:
